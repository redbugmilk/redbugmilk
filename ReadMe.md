# That's me Joana

I have worked as a software developer for nearly a decade. Initially, I started working in a completely different field. Still, I only felt good when I had an opportunity to develop scripts. Gradually, I have discovered my passion for creativity and innovation.

My love for software development has driven me to create a cross-platform mobile app in React Native. As an adventure developer, I've challenged myself to enter the back-end world, evolving and maintaining several microservices in different languages. I learned I liked reading code, understanding it, and maintaining consistency.

I am now back to mobile development, taking on new challenges and learning exciting new technologies like Kotlin, Kotlin multiplatform, and SwiftUI.

My journey has taught me that with hard work, determination, and a passion for what you do, anything is possible in the world of software development.
